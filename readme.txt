Bulk Page Generator is the solution for web developers and SEO professionals that want to create multiple pages in bulk for their lengthy projects.

In the Bulk Page Generator, you can create the post in three different ways, multiple posts with the same content, posts with different content, and the last posts with dynamic content. You can create the post with full details like title, content, thumbnail image, etc. Also, a great feature is given you can create data with dynamic content also.

**Post With Same Content**
As per the name of the tab, you know that here you can create multiple pages, posts, and products, but you have some restrictions, you have to create pages, posts, and products with the same content. But here you can create pages, posts, and products with a different title for each post and the rest of the content will remain the same. Users can use the "|" delimiter to separate the 2 titles. Content like post content, post excerpts, and featured images. The best thing is you can add pre-fix and post-fix to the post title. Also, users can change the post status and comment status.

**Post With Different Content**
Here you can create multiple pages, posts, and products with different content, you can add separately new pages, posts, or products with the content, title, excerpt, and featured image. You can add and delete these pages, posts, or products before you submit them, so you have a chance to modify the data before you live them. Other details may be the same as they don't so necessary to change. Post type, status, comment status, author, parent page, page template, etc details are the same for the content. The good thing about is that you can add the different titles with the pre-fix and post-fix so you can get extra different variants.
